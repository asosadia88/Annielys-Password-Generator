# Annielys-Password-Generator

## Description

This project focused on creating a random password generator. This random password generator will generate a unique password for every user that is in need of the password that is unique and meets he requirements of using a capital letter, lowercase, number and symbols. 

Many challenges were faced during this process given the beginner level of my experience still. Adjusting to JavaScript as a new language was more difficult than Html and CSS. However, I was able to further expand my critical thinking skills and hone in on my attention to detail in order to clean up the code as needed. I am certain I have much more to learn, but keeping a learner mentality will help with my success.
